1). We do not use sudo because we don't need to use "$(which node)" like previously, which
    requires root priveleges.

2). lab.js reads the contents of the .txt file. It does this in the background while outputting
    the "after readFile" to console.

3). Due to the async nature of the readFile, the program can execute the quicker action of
    outputting that message before reading and outputting the contents of the .txt file.

4). It looks like the toString function converts the contents of the file to a format more 
    compatible with human eyes (as opposed to the computer).

5). I specified the Content-Type in res.writeHead as txt/plain

6). As mentioned after class we would use a switch case to handle the different file types. Or
    build an object to handle it, both implementations seem like they would work well.

7). We would probably add the view files capability as one of the cases in the switch statement
    to give the user the choice to view or not. If we need it for our own purposes then it could
    just run in the background as an async function that can be called when needed.
